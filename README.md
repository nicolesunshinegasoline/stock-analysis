# Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to find out if refactoring the "AllStocksAnalysis" macro will successfully make the VBA script run faster.


# Results
- Using images and examples of your code


- Compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018


- As well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


# Summary
In a summary statement, address the following questions.


- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage of refactoring a code is that you have the opportunity to make the code run more efficiently by refactoring to include fewer steps, using less memory, and improve the logic to make the 
Achieving that more data can be processed in a significantly faster.



- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?






2017 vs 2018 Analysis

Over all, 2017 was a good year for all stocks except TERP, which was the only stock that had a negative return of 7.2%. However, when you look at 2018, we can see a dramatic shift in total daily volumes and yearly returns among all stocks.

Lets take a look at the top three tickers that had a significant increase in volume: DQ, ENPH, RUN.
- DQ had a sizable increase in daily volume, but a significant decrease in the yearly return from the previous year. This is an indication of pannic selling. Investors feel bearish about the stock, resulting in ,because the price is has siginifcatly dropped from the previous year. Indicating panic selling
- ENPH and RUN also had a sizable increase in daily volume. Unlike DQ, the price of these stocks were significatnly higher then the previous year. Meaning there has been a shift in how investors value the asset. Higher volume means asset is more competitive

Other stocks that has significantly decrease volumes, means that interest is waning. H


Yearly return = percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year

Daily volume = total # if shares traded throughout the day


Total Daily Volume increase significantly for DQ, but the return wad the worst out of all the stocks Panic selling = high volume?

Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This could be bearish or bullish depending on which way the price is heading.

Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well.

When average daily trading volume (ADTV) increases or decreases dramatically, it signals that there has been a substantial shift in how people value or view the asset.
